/**
 * Load up a help page.
 * Moodle 1.x provided a help functionality that would pop up a window containing 
 * an HTML help file.  In Moodle 2.0 this was dropped in favor of displaying
 * tool tip-type help and links back to moodle.org.  Unfortunately small plain text
 * tooltips are inadequate for Marginalia help.  Furthermore, linking back to
 * webmarginalia.net introduces more problems than it solves:  help pages would
 * need to be versioned, old versions would have to be maintained, and the volume
 * of requests could be expensive.  Including help documentation with the software
 * guarantees that it will refer to the correct version.
