Limitations and Known Bugs

I have only tested Marginalia with MySQL. It is likely it does not work with
other databases supported by Moodle, such as Postgres. That said, I have been
improving the database code in Marginalia and it is possible it might work.

Internet Explorer has limited support for a number of standards used by
Marginalia. Users of IE will find that it does not support some interface
refinements and may notice the software running more slowly.

If you discover bugs in Marginalia, please let me know. A lack of quality bug 
reports has been a significant barrier to improving the software.
