<h1>Marginalia Credits</h1>

<p>I (Geof Glass) wrote nearly all of the code for this project, although obviously not
for the excellent systems (Moodle, OJS, and Bungeni) with which it works.</p>

<p>I want to particularly thank BC Campus for funding this effort, and for allowing 
its release under the GNU General Public License, and to Simon Fraser University 
through Dr. Andrew Feenberg's Applied Communication and Technology Lab in the School 
of Communication and through the Learning and Instructional Development Centre
for their financial support.  Malaspina University-College has also been supportive,
as they provided a test site for Marginalia for Moodle.</p>

<p>Open Journal Systems support was made possible by Dr. Rick Kopak's "Navigating Information 
Spaces" project at the University of British Columbia, funded by the Social Sciences 
and Humanities Research Council of Canada.  Chia-ning Chiang and John Willinsky have 
also been essential in getting this project off the ground.</p>

<p>Plone integration, multiuser display, and numerous bug fixes and other improvements were
made possible by the UNDESA Africa i-Parliaments Action Plan project and their work
integrating Marginalia into Bungeni and Plone.</p>

<p>In addition, the following people
have provided moral and technical support.  Without these people and organizations this
software would not exist.  In rough chronological order:</p>
