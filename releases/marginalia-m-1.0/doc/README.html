<h1>Marginalia for Moodle Readme</h1>

<p>Marginalia for Moodle provides annotation support for Moodle discussion forums.  For updates to this release
and for a stand-alone demo version of the code, please see 
<a href="http://www.geof.net/code/annotation">my web site</a>.  The stand-alone version includes
some utilities and scripts that are not part of the Moodle distribution, such test frameworks
and the script that generates <kbd>html-model.js</kbd>.  I highlighy recommend this version
for anyone who plans to work with the source code, even within Moodle.  The stand-alone version
is a much clearer example of how annotation works, and includes additional documentation in the 
example source code.</p>

<p>The following files contain further documentation on specific topics.  In particular,
see <kbd>INSTALL</kbd> for installation istructions.  There are two versions of
these files:  HTML files in the <kbd>doc</kbd> directory, and raw text versions here.</p>

<h2>License &amp; Funding</h2>

<p>See <a href='CREDITS.html'>CREDITS</a> for details on contributors to this
project.</p>

<p>I want to particularly thank BC Campus for funding this effort, and for allowing 
its release under the GNU General Public License, and to Simon Fraser University 
through Dr. Andrew Feenberg's Applied Communication and Technology Lab in the School 
of Communication and through the Learning and Instructional Development Centre
for their financial support.  Malaspina University-College has also been supportive,
as they provided a test site for Marginalia for Moodle.</p>

<p>Open Journal Systems support and other improvements to Marginalia were 
made possible by Dr. Rick Kopak's "Navigating Information 
Spaces" project at the University of British Columbia, funded by the Social Sciences 
and Humanities Research Council of Canada.  Chia-ning Chiang and John Willinsky have 
also been essential in getting this project off the ground.</p>
 
<p>The UNDESA "Africa i-Parliaments Action Plan" project implemented edit actions,
the per-paragraph multiuser support, and a number of other improvements.  Thank
you to Flavio Zeni, Jean Jordaan, and Ashok Hariharan for all their help and support.</p>

<h2>Limitations and Known Bugs</h2>

<p>I am aware of several limitations with the software:</p>

<ul>
<li>This version has not yet been tested and fixed for Internet Explorer.  It
may work with IE to an extent, and I plan to make any necessary fixes.  Other
browsers may display annotations, but they probably won't allow them to be
created.</li>
<li>I have only tried annotation with a MySQL database.  It's possible there
are incompatibilities with others (e.g. Postgres).</li>
<li>Smartcopy links are stripped by the HTML editor in Moodle.  If the
path to a link is in a different directory, the link won't work.  I don't want
to disable this behavior without understanding exactly why it's there.</li>
<li>Annotations cannot be edited from the summary page.</li>
<li>Annotation is incompatible with the Firefox "Auto Copy" extension if the
extension is set to automatically clear the selection once it has been copied
(this can be modified with the "Auto Copy" preferences).</li>
</ul>

<p>Internet Explorer support does not (will not) support a number of refinements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Smartcopy is not implemented for IE.</li>
<li>The create annotation button does not highlight when the mouse is over it.</li>
<li>If an annotation cannot be displayed in the right location because the document
has changed (and hence the highlight can't be located), IE does not display the error
indicator explaining the problem.  However, the full annotation is still visible in
the summary page.</li>
</ul>
