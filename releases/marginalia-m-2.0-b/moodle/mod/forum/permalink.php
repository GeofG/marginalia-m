/*
 * I have added this so that messages can have permanent URLs, even when they are
 * "split" (i.e., moved between discussions), which is something I need for annotation.
 * This doesn't actually show the message;  rather, it redirects to the correct
 * discussion.  It's a bit of a hack, but it's minimally invasive to the forum code.
 *
 * Logically this should be called post.php, but that name is already taken by a script
 * that creates or saves changes to posts.
