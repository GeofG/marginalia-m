 * Code has been moved to moodle_marginalia.php to make it possible to more
 * finely determine which code is needed for a given page.
 *
 * Marginalia has been developed with funding and support from
 * BC Campus, Simon Fraser University, and the Government of
 * Canada, the UNDESA Africa i-Parliaments Action Plan, and  
 * units and individuals within those organizations.  Many 
 * thanks to all of them.  See CREDITS.html for details.

/*
 * Moodle automatically loads this lib.php file on every page if the 
 * Marginalia block is enabled.  It would be really cool if we could 
 * emit the headers here.  But... it cannot be.  Because we need PAGE->url
 * to figure out what to emit.  So there's no way to avoid a patch point.
